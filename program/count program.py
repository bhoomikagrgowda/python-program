s1=banu
sub=a
#1st iteration
s1=b
sub=a
now we have to compare b with a
it is not true so do not increement c value(c=0)
                                    

#2st iteration
s1=a
sub=a
now we have to compare a with a
it is true so do increement c value(c=1)

#3st iteration
s1=n
sub=a
now we have to compare n with a
it is not true so do not increement c value(c=1)

#4st iteration
s1=u
sub=a
now we have to compare u with a
it is not true so do not increement c value(c=1)
